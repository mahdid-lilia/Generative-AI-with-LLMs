# Generative AI with LLMs - Coursera Course

## üìñ Overview
This repository contains materials and notes from the **Generative AI with LLMs** course offered by Coursera. The course provides a comprehensive understanding of how generative AI works and how it can be deployed in real-world applications. It emphasizes practical intuition and best practices for utilizing large language models (LLMs).

By completing this course, learners gain skills to:
- Understand the generative AI lifecycle, from data gathering and model selection to performance evaluation and deployment.
- Describe the transformer architecture that powers LLMs and explain training and fine-tuning techniques for specific use cases.
- Optimize model performance using empirical scaling laws for dataset size, compute budget, and inference requirements.
- Apply advanced methods for training, tuning, inference, and deployment to maximize performance.
- Analyze the challenges and opportunities of generative AI in business contexts, supported by insights from industry experts.

This intermediate-level course is ideal for developers with Python programming experience and foundational knowledge of machine learning concepts such as supervised and unsupervised learning, loss functions, and data splitting.
